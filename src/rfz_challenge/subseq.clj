;; cop-out -- technically equal-subseqs isn't correct at the moment.  It should
;; return nil if it can't create segments that cover the entire input, but
;; instead it just returns as many segments as it can, which is often only one.
;; Out of time now, so I'm just running it against all potential sums, sort by
;; number of segments created, and take the one that creates the most segments.
;; Lame but works for the challenge.
